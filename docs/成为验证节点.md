## Overview

PlatON is a blockchain project that implements democratic governance. Verification nodes are jointly selected by all LAT holders to maintain and develop the PlatON network. The 201 nodes with the most votes will become candidate nodes, from which 43 verification nodes will be randomly selected using VRF to participate in the management of the entire PlatON network.

This section describes how to operate as a validator node.



## *Preparation*

Before becoming a validator node, please ensure that the server meets the following requirements:

- The PlatON node has been installed and the node key have been created according to the instructions of [Installing a Node](/docs/en/Install_Node)
- Start the node and [join the PlatON network](/docs/en/Join_PlatON_NetWork)



## Install PlatON MTool

Proceed as follows:

**Step1. Download PlatON MTool toolkit**

```bash
wget https://download.platon.network/platon/mtool/linux/1.0.0/platon_mtool.zip
```

**Step2. Extract the PlatON MTool toolkit**

```bash
(if ! command -v unzip;then sudo apt install unzip; fi;) && unzip platon_mtool.zip && cd platon_mtool
```

**Step3. Download script**

> The script is downloaded to the <font color=red>platon_mtool</font> directory, otherwise the script cannot find the path of the new version of mtool.

```bash
wget https://download.platon.network/platon/scripts/mtool_install.sh
```

**Step4. Execute command**

```bash
chmod +x mtool_install.sh && ./mtool_install.sh
```

> - When the message <font color=red>Install platon mtool succeed.</font> is displayed, PlatON MTool is successfully installed. If it is not successfully installed, please contact our official customer service to provide feedback on specific issues.

**Step5. Restart the session window**

After installation is complete, you need to <font color=red>restart the session window (do not restart the server, close the session window or SSH tool to reopen the window)</font> for the newly added environment variables to take effect.

## Configure PlatON MTool

### Generate wallet

To participate in the verification node to produce blocks, two wallets must be created. If you already have a wallet, you can skip this step by copying the wallet file to the `$PLATON_MTOOLDIR/keystore` directory.

- Staking wallet: The staking wallet is used to stake tokens. To become a candidate node, you must stake successfully. Run the following command to create a staking wallet:

```bash
platon_mtool account new staking
```

Enter the password once and confirm the password again to create a wallet file. After the creation is successful, a staking wallet file `staking.json` will be generated in the directory` $PLATON_MTOOLDIR/keystore`.

- Reward wallet: It is used to collect block rewards and staking rewards. Staking rewards are uniformly distributed to verification nodes, which are distributed by the verification nodes themselves. Run the following command to create a reward wallet

```bash
platon_mtool account new reward
```

Enter the password once and confirm the password again to create the wallet file. After the creation is successful, the staking wallet file `reward.json` will be generated in the directory` $PLATON_MTOOLDIR/keystore`.



### Configure verification node information

#### Download the script

```bash
cd $PLATON_MTOOLDIR && wget https://download.platon.network/platon/scripts/validator_conf.sh
```

#### Run the script configuration

```bash
$ chmod +x validator_conf.sh && ./validator_conf.sh
```

> **Note:**
>
> - When  the prompt shows "Please enter the platon node IP address:", please enter the PlatON node server ip address.
> - When  the prompt shows "validator conf success",  and when the validator_config.json content printed at the end is normal, it means that the script is executed successfully. If the script is not executed successfully, please contact our official customer service to feedback specific questions.



#### Validator node information configuration file description

After the configuration of the validator node information is completed, the validator node information file validator_config.json will be generated in the validator subdirectory of the PlatON MTool installation directory. The file content is as follows:

```json
{
	"nodePublicKey": "0abaf3219f454f3d07b6cbcf3c10b6b4ccf605202868e2043b6f5db12b745df0604ef01ef4cb523adc6d9e14b83a76dd09f862e3fe77205d8ac83df707969b47",
    "blsPubKey": "82d740cbc0314ec558c5426f88fdad6f07a07f9846c6be4e40cd628b74b9f641ddad01e4c281a2c3693f8ff2a73a410297aff379ee0575127d51de99b97acc9a1b7bc8ca132ef6f0379a3ec9d76a603d623176e49e1c53e87fead36317895099",
	"nodeAddress": "http://192.168.120.146",
	"nodePort": "16789",
	"nodeRpcPort": "6789"
}
```

> **Parameter description:**
>
> - nodePublicKey: Node ID, which can be viewed in the nodeid file under the node data directory data
> - blsPubKey: BLS public key, which can be viewed in the blspub file under the node data directory data.
> - nodeAddress: If PlatON MTool and the node are on the same machine or in the same local area network, you can use the intranet IP, otherwise use the public IP whose format is: `http://18.238.183.12`.
> - nodePort: Node P2P port, default is 16789.
> - nodeRpcPort: rpc port, the default port is 6789.

#### Custom PlatScan avatar

If users do not need to display their specified avatar on PlatScan, they can skip this step. Otherwise, the following operations are required:

- **Register a keybase account**

  Users first need to register on the official website of  [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) . If they have already registered, they can log on the official website of keybase.

- **Upload specified avatar**

  Click the user avatar to upload the avatar.

- **Generate PGP key**

  If the user has a `PGP key`, after a successful login, a series of 16-bit public keys will be displayed next to the user's avatar, such as: `EB621920A48D0699`; if the user does not already have a `PGP key`, click `add a PGP key` next to the user's avatar to generate.

- **Specify the externalId value**

  When issuing the staking operation, specify the `--external_id` parameter to be the PGP key generated in the previous step.

> Note: After the user completes the staking operation, the avatar customized by the user can be displayed on PlatScan.

## Initiate a staking operation

If the consensus node deployment is complete and is catching up the blocknumber of [Platscan](https://platscan.platon.network), you can use PlatON MTool for staking operations. Please ensure that the balance of the staking account is sufficient before staking. The minimum threshold for staking is one hundred thousand LAT. If you want to access the development network, please send an email to support@latticex.foundation according to the format requirements. The email requirements are:

```toml
Title: Platon Development Network Token Application
Name:
Contact Information:
WeChat ID (or other instant messaging software) :
Application amount:
USES:
Receipt account:
Remark:
```

Note: 

- Testing LAT has no value and is limited to experiencing test network features.

- Please keep at least 1 LAT in the staking account, so that the transactions initiated by the subsequent node management have sufficient transaction fees, such as voting for upgrade proposals, and unsecured transactions.
